                      <p>
                        &mdash; I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency,
                        by far. Nobody's ever been more successful than me. I'm the most
                        successful person ever to run. Ross Perot isn't successful like me.

                        Sorry losers and haters, but my IQ is one of the highest &mdash; and you all

                      Started Trump University with Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny:
                      no grades, certificates and other bureaucracy, but program offered courses
                      in real estate, asset management entrepreneurship, and wealth creation.
                      98% students gave positive reviews while studying, however some of these ungrateful
                      gringos filed lawsuits against Trump University after the course. I had to pay $25 million to settle that...

                      That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle.

                      a crew of undocumented Polish workers to demolish the historic Bonwit
                      Teller store, including art deco features. All this to make architectural
                      critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is
                      "the most pleasant interior public space to be completed in New York
                      in some years". At the same time I also started a repair job on the Wollman
                      Rink in Central Park and completed the work in three months for $1.95 million,
                      which was $775,000 less than the initial budget!
